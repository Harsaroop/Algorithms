# Algorithms
A repository for popular and efficient Algorithms in Python

I am creating this Repository to contribute my part in developers community by sharing efficient algorithms in Python


Here i will be listing here all the algorithms with a little overview :-
1. Seive of Eratosthenes :- One of the most efficient algorihtm to find prime numbers below 10 miliion or so
2. Union-Find Algorithm :- An algorithm to find if a graph is a cyclic or not
